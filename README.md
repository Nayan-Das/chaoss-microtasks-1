# CHAOSS Micro-tasks

This repository has the microtasks for the project **Machine Learning for Anomaly Detection in Open Source Communities**.
- [X] **Microtask 0:** Familiarize yourself with augur by downloading and configuring the dev branch. For a little more context about what we are trying to accomplish with Augur's prototyping, checkout Augur's documentation at : https://oss-augur.readthedocs.io/en/dev/ Fork Augur into your own GitHub Account. Work in the dev branch.

- [X] **Microtask 1:** Using any machine learning algorithm or library you are comfortable experimenting with, identify data anomalies in the commits, pull_requests, issues, or "messages" tables. The database structure is in the documentation noted above. You would choose "messages" if you have a particular interest in computational linguistics oriented machine learning. You do not need to build your analysis as a worker.
